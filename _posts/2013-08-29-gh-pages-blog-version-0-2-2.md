An update to gh-pages-blog was just pushed up to GitHub to address a bug that was keeping the site from rendering when an author attribute was added to a post. For more information, please see this [post](http://thedereck.github.io/gh-pages-blog/version%200.2/2013/08/29/version-0-2-2.html).

Happy blogging.
